## What is this tool?

This simple tool is a way to analyze the relationship of a provided group of
addresses. It tries to determine which addresses fund other addresses with the
aim to detect possible bot accounts.

## Instructions

1. Update `addresses.go` with address list.

2. Run program.

```bash
go run cmd/main.go
```
Depending on the size of the address list the amount of time could be quite
awhile.

3. Analyze output.

Any address that has a (*) next to it is an address that exists in the address
list. TRUNKs are addresses which fork off to have many children (CHILD)
addresses which could be bot addresses. The ITERATION number is used to match which
TRUNK matches with which CHILDREN. The DEPTH number is used to show how many
levels away from the TRUNK the address is.

```bash
